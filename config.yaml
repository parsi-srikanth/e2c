# Description:
# E2C uses this yaml file to setup the computing system for simulation.
# The config file has two parts: 
#   (i)  E2C paramters:
#         This part is used to control the behavior of E2C.
#   (ii) system parametrs:
#          This part is used to setup different components of the computing 
#          system for the simulation in E2C. The settings are for loadbalancer,
#          scheduler, and tiers. Macines, tasks, and battery are also defined
#          for each tier.
